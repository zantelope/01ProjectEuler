If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

bruteForce.py is, well, just that.

sumOfMultiplesOfTwoNumbersInRange.py: terrible name, but much more efficient. Utilizes concepts of finite arithmetic progression, finite arithmetic series (sum of progression), and the inclusion-exclusion principle. Introduces idea of combinatorics, the study of finite discreet structures. Also allows for user input to solve problem for other values and limits.
